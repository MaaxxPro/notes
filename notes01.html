    <h1>Web Basics</h1>
    <p>IP: Internet Protocol, the specific address of a computer that identifies it among the billions connected to the web

    <p>Domain Names are aliases for IP addresses

    <p>Internet =/= Web
    <p>Internet is technical infrastructure
    <p>Web is a service built on top of that infrastructure
    <p>Intranets are private networks, extranets are networks opened up to other networks to share information between.</p>
    <p>Both run on the same infrastructure as the web, and so can be accessed from various locations.</p>
    <h4>Web Page</h4>
    <p>A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often called just "pages."</p>
    <h4>Web Site</h4>
    <p>A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "web site" or a "site."</p>
    <h4>Web Server</h4>
    <p>A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.</p>
    <h4>Search Engine</h4>
    <p>A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo.
        Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser 
        (e.g. you can perform search engine searches directly in the address bar of Firefox, Chrome, etc.) 
        or through a web page (e.g. bing.com or duckduckgo.com).</p>
    <h4>Browser vs Search Engine</h4>
    <p>A browser is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages; a search engine is a website that helps people find web pages from other websites.</p>
    <p><strong>domain names</strong> are read <em>right</em> to <em>left</em></p>
    <h4>Top Level Domain (TLD)</h4>
        <p>(“.com” “.net”)</p>
        <p>some TLDs enforce stricter policies so it is clearer what their purpose is. For example:</p>
        <p>Local TLDs such as .us, .fr, or .se can require the service to be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country — they are supposed to indicate a resource in a particular language or country.
            <p>TLDs containing .gov are only allowed to be used by government departments.
            <p>The .edu TLD is only for use by educational and academic institutions.
        </p>
    <h4>The Label</h4>
        <p>a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to sixty-three characters in length, containing only the letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the - character (which may not be the first or last character in the label)</p>
        <p>You can create subdomains by adding additional labels, with a dot. “subdomain.label.tld”

        <p>Use whois command on domain registry services to query domain name availability
            </p>
    <h4>Protocols</h4>
        <p><em>Define how data should travel across the web</em></p>
        <p>TCP "Transmission Control Protocol</p>
        <p>IP "Internet Protocol"</p>
        <p>HTTP "Hypertext Transfer Protocol": The language used by client and server</p>
    <h4>Component Files, Code Files, and Assets</h4>
        <p>Component Files make up a website. Code Files are the actual code, and Assets are the rest (images, pdfs, whatever)</p>

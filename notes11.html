        <h1>CSS 2: The Cascade</h1>

        <h3>Specificity</h3>    

            <p>Sometimes CSS styles will conflict and the way that the browser determines who wins is called the cascade.</p>
            <p>Each selector has a value and those values determine their specificity in being applied over other styles.</p>
            <ul>Some selectors and their values
                <li>Type: 1</li>
                <li>Class: 10</li>
                <li>ID: 100</li>
                <li>In-line: 1000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that 101 type selectors would be required to override an ID applied style, or 11 class selectors (according to the video).</p>
            <p>According to the lesson, specificity is not comparative - the ID selector will beat any number of class selectors.</p>
            <p>The specificity of a rule is determined by the value of the element it applies to, as well as the number of selectors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Value of a selector is first to determine specificity.
                        An ID specified rule will take precedence over class.
                    </li>
                    <li>The number of selectors will also apply.
                        A rule aimed at two classes will precede a rule aimed at a single class.
                        A rule aimed at an ID and two classes will precede a rule aimed at the same ID and only one class.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Universal Selector has no value, and any rules applying to all will only take effect if no other rules apply to an element.</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>If a style is applied to an element that contains another element, that style will <em>usually</em> be applied to the descendant elements.</p>
            <p>Most typography based properties such as color and font will be inherited, while most other properties will not.</p>
            <p>Inheritance can be easily overridden, as a style applied to a descendant element always takes precedence.
                Even if the parent is an ID and the child is class, the rule applying to the class will take precedence 
                (unless the rule is a combinator applying specifically to the child)
            </p>
        <h3>Rule Order</h3>
            <p>The last aspect of the cascade determines which rule takes precedence if the specifictiy is the same.</p>
            <p>When multiple styles are applied in a conflicting manner and are equally specific, whichever one is last (ie lower in the stylesheet) takes precedence.</p>
